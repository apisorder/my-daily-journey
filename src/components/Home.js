                Despite similarities in their names, JavaScript has little in common to Java. 
                Aside from their C-like syntax, the untyped JavaScript programming language 
                has no relation to the static-typed Java programming language. JavaScript 
                language specifications are provided by the European Computer Manufactures 
                Associations (ECMA), and consequently JavaScript is sometimes referred to as 
                ECMAScript. However, the two are not identical: JavaScript implements features 
                in addition to those listed in the ECMAScript specification. ECMAScript is 
                often abbreviated as ES, and the 2015 specification (commonly referred to as 
                ES6, as it is the sixth edition) separates JavaScript from what is named 
                modern JavaScript. JavaScript Tutor covers fundamentals of modern JavaScript.
